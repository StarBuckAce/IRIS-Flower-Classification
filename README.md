# Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and provides a great starting point for understanding supervised learning.
